"""Device drawings for every Sonos model the bridge knows about.

Each speaker is described as the face you look at plus the depth it stands in,
and folded back through one shared three-quarter projection, so the whole set
is drawn from the same viewpoint: a Five is a wide cabinet, an Era 300 keeps
its cinched waist, a Sub the slot cut through it, a soundbar its length.  Only
the edges you could actually see are stroked.

The shapes are composed in a generous square and then fitted to a 32 x 32 grid,
which :mod:`sonosbridge.icon` rasterises into the PNGs served over UPnP and
``tools/gen_device_icons.py`` writes out as an SVG sprite.  Nothing here needs a
drawing library, and there are no binary assets to keep in sync.
